In recent years scientists have made strides in progressing prosthetics. Merriam-webster defines prosthetics as &quot;an artificial device to replace or augment a missing or impaired part of the body&quot;. One of the means of progress is 3d printing. The prosthetic hand on the right of this picture is 3d printed, while the prosthetic on the left is not. Before we discuss the benefits of printing prosthetics, we'll discuss the process of 3d printing.

<aside class="notes">
3D printers take in an electronic model such as a .STl file. The model needs to be &quot;sliced&quot;, which is taking the model and dividing it into numerous horizontal layers. Then the printer &quot;prints&quot; the object layer by layer. Each machine has its own unique way of printing, but all of them go layer by layer.

3D printers can use ABS plastic, wax, metals, nylon or stone. You can pretty much print anything if you're willing to pay the price for the material. Recently some implants have been printed with live cells, which is an advance in the medical field.

<p>Versatility and Efficiency</p>
<aside class="notes">
Prosthetics can be printed into basically any shape needed by translating scans, such as x-rays or MRI scans, into .STL files. They can take as few as 24 hours to print. These scans allow for greater accuracy in creating custom prosthetics because often standardized prosthetics are not good enough for unique patients.

Victims of head trauma have parts of their skulls removed to give the brain room to swell. They must be fitted with cranial plates that fit perfectly after this, and 3D printing allows for a more perfect fit.

<aside class="notes">
<pre><code>This is a dog named Derby who was born with deformed front legs, which made it hard for him to walk. A 3D printing company in South Carolina found out about his situation and created prosthetics for him from a 3d Printer. They used a type of printing process called &quot;Selective Laser Sintering&quot;, which uses a laser to heat powder just below it&#39;s boiling point (sintering), which fuses the powder into a solid form. In Derby&#39;s case, they used a Nylon powder because it has flexibile properties, which allows the prosthetic to be bouncy, so Derby can run!</code></pre>

<aside class="notes">
At Rochester Institute of Technology's e-NABLE, 3D printed hands are created for children. Because prosthetic limbs can cost $40,000 many parents decline to purchase prosthetic limbs that the children will soon grow out of. e-NABLE 3D prints hands and gives them to children for free since the cost of printing plastic is usually no more than $20. In turn, this inspires the children to be interested in technology and 3D printing. http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/3-d-printers-put-limb-prosthetics-for-kids-in-reach/

<pre><code>UNC offers workshops about 3d printing! Sarah and I attended one recently and learned a lot about the process. This is one of the 3d printers at UNC. On the right you can see the spool of plastic that is being fed into the machine, and you can see how the object is being printed layer by layer. At the workshop we attended, we were given a basic overview about the process of 3d printing, and different resources you can find online to help you make 3d printable files if you don&#39;t have a lot of experience. You have to go through a rigorous training if you want to actually use the 3d printers yourself, but you can submit files to the Kenan Library, and they will print up to 300 grams of 3d printed goods for you every month! It doesn&#39;t even have to be related to a class!</code></pre>

The second link is to a list of 3d printing workshops, like the one Emma and I attended! There are more opportunities to learn about 3d printing at UNC than one would expect, and since it&#39;s included with your tuition, it&#39;s a great thing to take advantage of!</code></pre>
