# What is 3D printing?

```
    @sarah or emma insert ppic ok
```    

<aside class="notes">
3D printing, which is also known as additive manufacturing, uses computers to 
form and create 3D objects from a digital source.

# How does it work?

```
    The process
```

<aside class="notes">
3D printers take in an electronic model such as a .STl file. The model needs to
be "sliced", which is taking the model and dividing it into numerous horizontal
layers. Then the printer "prints" the object layer by layer. Each machine has 
its own unique way of printing, but all of them go layer by layer.

# What does it print with?

```
    Materials
```
  <aside class="notes">
3D printers can use ABS plastic, wax, metals, nylon or stone. You can pretty 
much print anything if you're willing to pay the price for the material. Recently

# General Uses

```

    * aerospace engineering
    * architecture
    * medical fields
    * art

# Prosthetics

```
    What is a prosthetic?
```
<aside class="notes">
Merriam-webster defines prosthetics as "an artificial device to replace or augment
a missing or impaired part of the body".

# 3D Printing Prosthetics

```
    Versatility and Efficiency 
```
<aside class="notes">
Prosthetics can be printed into basically any shape needed by translating scans, such
as x-rays or MRI scans, into .STL files. They can take as few as 24 hours to
print. These scans allow for greater accuracy in creating custom prosthetics because
often standardized prosthetics are not good enough for unique patients.

# probably connect to animals somehow. probably

# why 3d printing is great and also the future

# our experience with 3d printing workshop

# maybe 3d printing resources around campus. like links to the library schedule

# yay!!!!!!!
