# What is 3D printing?

<aside class="notes">
3D printing, which is also known as additive manufacturing, uses computers to 
form and create 3D objects from a digital source.
</aside>

# How does it work?

```
    The process
```

<aside class="notes">
3D printers take in an electronic model such as a .STl file. The model needs to
be "sliced", which is taking the model and dividing it into numerous horizontal
layers. Then the printer "prints" the object layer by layer. Each machine has 
its own unique way of printing, but all of them go layer by layer.

# What does it print with?

```
    Materials
```
  <aside class="notes">
3D printers can use ABS plastic, wax, metals, nylon or stone. You can pretty 
much print anything if you're willing to pay the price for the material. Recently
some implants have been printed with live cells, which is an advance in the
medical field.

# General Uses

    * aerospace engineering
    * architecture
    * medical fields
    * art

# Prosthetics

```
    What is a prosthetic?
```
<aside class="notes">
Merriam-webster defines prosthetics as "an artificial device to replace or augment
a missing or impaired part of the body".

# 3D Printing Prosthetics

```
    Versatility and Efficiency 
```
<aside class="notes">
Prosthetics can be printed into basically any shape needed by translating scans, such
as x-rays or MRI scans, into .STL files. They can take as few as 24 hours to
print. These scans allow for greater accuracy in creating custom prosthetics because
often standardized prosthetics are not good enough for unique patients.

# Example uses: Head injuries

```
    Skulls
```
<aside class="notes">
Victims of head trauma have parts of their skulls removed to give the brain room
to swell. They must be fitted with cranial plates that fit perfectly after this, 
and 3D printing allows for a more perfect fit.</aside>

# Example uses: Pawsthetics

Every top level markdown header in this file will be translated into a "section" in your HTML5 output. This output will be plain, using only the base reveal.js style. The command above, mutatis mutandis, will let you do the conversion.

# Example uses: Children

```
Rochester Institute of Technology's e-NABLE
```
<aside class="notes">
At Rochester Institute of Technology's e-NABLE, 3D printed hands are
created for children. Because prosthetic limbs can cost $40,000 many parents decline
to purchase prosthetic limbs that the children will soon grow out of. e-NABLE
3D prints hands and gives them to children for free since the cost of printing
plastic is usually no more than $20. In turn, this inspires the children to be
interested in technology and 3D printing.

# So how can you get involved with 3D printing?

<aside class="notes">
If you're interested in 3D printing, the Kenan Science Library at UNC will print up to 
300 grams per month for you for free. They'll help you create a model and function 
as a print shop. If you'd like to learn how to 3D print there are safety workshops
you must first go through.
